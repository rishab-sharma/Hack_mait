Author: Rishab Sharma - MAIT , New Delhi

Regardless of how smart our cities become, the goals of our emergency services will stay the same - prevent harm,
keep people safe, and help them in their greatest need. However the delivery of these functions will look very different.
Here are four ways Blue Light services are set to change.
Here are FOUR emergency services that will come to your aid if you are in trouble.  
They are the Police, Fire Brigade , Ambulance Service and Electricity. Emergency services are usually free.
Also a special provision for our geek pals , we also provide a Internet emergency service which you can reach out for help on a attack like DDOS or SQLInjection.

Stay Safe , Be it home or Internet
